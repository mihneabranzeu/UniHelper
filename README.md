# UniHelper
UniHelper is one of my personal projects, in search for better understanding and learning how to develop Android apps.
UniHelper, as its name might suggest, is an app that tries to help university students by offering an easy means of communication between students, but also betwwen students and their teachers. The final app will also provide a school schedule for the students and attendance statistics.
